# Predicting if a person will buy a life insurnace premium or not based on his age using logistic regression.

The problem involves using logistic regression to predict whether a person will purchase life insurance or not, based on their age. Since there are only two possible outcomes (i.e. purchase or not purchase), it is considered a binary logistic regression problem.

The data is available as a CSV file `insurance-data.csv`.
